Kairos is a stand alone event store with built in management tools.

It is stand alone in the sense that given only a single Karios database all required tools and data to derive the semantics of the stored events are provided.

It is stand alone in the sense that it provides a language neutral network interface for easy integration in any environment.

It has built in support for
  * Ad hoc querying for debugging and one off extractions
  * Backup and restore
  * To be continued...

It is the aim of Kairos to provide the same level of support and sense of security for data managment as mature RDBMS systems. Albeit for a vastly simpler data model and performance characteristics.
